# hello-world
first repository
hi everyone 
i am zeeshan ali
First homework completed .
Took a very long time .
Still some confusions are there .
First of all, made an account on github.
Then installed eclipse an my linux PC.
Made a new Java project Helloworld and a new Java class of the same name.
Executed the programme in Eclipse.
At the end i uploaded my project files in the master branch of my github account.
